# Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera
This repo is meant to help the students of Deep learning Specialization in Coursera taken by Andrew NG.

This Specialization involves 5 sub topics namely

1. Neural Networks and Deep learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models

This Repository contains the solutions for all the Sub topics(both practice questions and programming assignemnts)
